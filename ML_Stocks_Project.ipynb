    "# Initial Clarifications about the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the analysis and evaluation of Machine Learning and Data Analytics tools to determine the optimal models in predicting the profitability of stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "The project does not aim to provide incentives or advice on stock investments.\n",
    "Any investment, including ETFs, comes with risks. Before investing in an ETF, it's crucial to fully research and understand its characteristics and risks.\n",
    "It's highly recommended to consult with a financial advisor or investment expert when exploring investment options.\n",
    "Scope of the Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will center our analysis on the opening and closing prices of stocks, as well as other relevant data available in our dataset. We will not consider external information, such as geopolitical, environmental factors, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective of the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to predict the profitability of exchange-traded funds, known as ETFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are ETFs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ETFs are investment funds that are traded on the stock exchange, similar to company stocks. Unlike a stock that represents ownership in a specific company, an ETF reflects a basket of assets, which can include stocks, bonds, commodities, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of ETFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.- Diversification: Investing in an ETF means diversifying across multiple assets. For example, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index offers exposure to the 500 companies that compose it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.- Liquidity: ETFs can be bought or sold on stock exchanges during market hours, just like stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.- Low Costs: Typically, ETFs have lower costs compared to other funds, as they often follow a passive approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.- Flexibility: There are ETFs for various indices, sectors, markets, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.- Transparency: ETFs tend to be transparent, regularly publishing their assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will identify the top 5 ETFs and analyze the stocks of the companies that compose them. From this, we aim to predict the individual profitability of these stocks, which will allow us to estimate the overall profitability of the corresponding ETF."
